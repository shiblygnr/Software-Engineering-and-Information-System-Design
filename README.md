# Software-Engineering-and-Information-System-Design
This is a project of CSE411 - Software Engineering and Information System Design

#Project Name: Course Management System

#Description

This software can be used by both instructors and students to manage all the courses semesterwise starting from course registration to grade submission. Both users have their seperate login to enter the system. The students can keep track of their attendances, marks, class scedules, respective currently enrolled course-wise faculty members' contact information, register courses for the next semester, sending registration slip via email, print it and so on. They can also see their gradesheet and appropriate printing of the gradesheet is also available. 
On the other hand, a faculty member can use this system for class attendance of his/her assigned sections. The marks of the attendance will add to the databse based on the students attentivity accordingly. They can update students' attendances too. A faculty member can see the details of the students who are enrolled in his/her courses. The can perform student-wise assessment and grading of the students too. And finally, the users of this system can edit their personal details too. For more details, you are invited to visit the application.
